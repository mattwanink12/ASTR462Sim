# ASTR462Sim

Simulation model of Ha et al. (2005) for use in utilizing FLASH to investigate the jet-to-ambient density parameter and its role in governing the behavior of astrophysical jet systems. Paper linked in repository as sim_model.pdf. My full write-up on the subject also linked in the repository as ASTR_462_Project.pdf. My modifications reside in the flash parameter files for the underdense and overdense jet simulation models.
